# Driver Drowsiness Detection
> A python based driver drowsiness detection system from real time video. Eyes are detected using dlib facial landmarks.

## General Information
- It is natural to feel drowsy while driving.
- Drowsiness may lead to fatal road accidents.
- This project can alert the driver when he is drowsy.
- A simple python code that takes real time video as input.

## Technologies Used
- Python - version 3.10.4

## Screenshots
> The following information is showed by the system when the driver drives with complete attention. The landmarks of the eye is detected by the facial landmark detection based on dlib. The horizontal and vertical distances of different eye points are calculated to get the eye aspect ratio.

> When the eyes are closed for definite amount of time and if the eye aspect ratio is less than the given threshold value, then an alert is generated by our system. We consider some time i.e wait for some frame to avoid general closing of our eye lids.
